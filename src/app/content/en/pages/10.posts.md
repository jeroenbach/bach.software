# Blog

Through this blog, I'll capture and share techniques for writing great software - especially those too specific or
opinionated to create a full library.
I'll also implement some of the concepts I've used at client projects in a more anonymous and generalised way,
making it possible to share what otherwise couldn't be open-sourced.
