# Portfolio

Below you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on that are still publicly accessible.

Most of my work so far has been on proprietary and internal applications, which makes it tricky to build a portfolio that fully reflects what I've done.

With this blog and future open source projects, I'm aiming to change that.

I've gained a lot from free and open source librariesâ€”not to mention the countless articles that have helped me write better software for customers and employers. It's time to give something back. Stay tuned for future open source projects and articles to help you build better software too.
