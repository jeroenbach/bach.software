# Portfolio

Below is a selection of publicly accessible projects I've worked on.

Much of my work has involved proprietary or internal applications, making it difficult to build a portfolio
that fully reflects my experience. Through this blog and future open source projects, I aim to change that.

In the meantime, feel free to explore some of the projects I can share.
